The following datasets are directly extracted from the database:


Benthic_Community.csv: data about prey species
environment.csv: data about environmental conditions
Fish_Diet.csv: stomach content of fish
trawlings.csv: trawling (fish sampling) locations and dates
detection_weigths.csv: correction factor for the detectability of prey in stomachs
fish_date_aggregation.csv: when two samplings were done at two following dates, considered as one sampling event (reduces the specificity of the communities limiting associated biases).

Script:
do_connections_between_guts_and_env.R: 
	- associate the fisch data to the prey data, depending on dates and locations
	- add information on environmental conditions (temperature)
	- apply the filter to remove all fishes for which we don't have an estimation of the prey community close enough in time

The script creates the following files:

../generated_files/fish_diet_analyses_31.csv: what is found in stomachs (to estimate realised distributions)
../generated_files/benthic_for_analyses_31.csv what is found in the environment (to estimate environmental distributions)
